These required more mental effort, and because they were at the end of the test, my focus was reduced.

I thought it moved three times, but it actually moved <strong>four times</strong>: 1 to yellow, 3 left to black, 1 right to green, 2 right to red. Since the counter increased each move, the correct count was 4, not 3.</p>\n",
