    "    <p>I struggled with <strong>data compression</strong>, <strong>mathematical expressions</strong>, <strong>strings</strong>, <strong>calling procedures</strong>, and <strong>random values</strong>. These questions required more mental effort and showed up near the end of the test when my focus started to drop. Some questions took too long to finishâ€”I'll need to work on speed and focus if I want to complete future sets under 1.5 hours.</p>\n",

    "    <p>I lost focus and miscounted how many times the game piece moved. I thought it only moved 3 times, but it actually moved 4: right to yellow, left to black, right to green, then right again to red. The counter increases each time, so the correct answer was 4, not 3.</p>\n",

    "    <p>I didnâ€™t notice the problem was with calling <code>RANDOM(1, 4)</code> twice in one loop iteration. Only 94 of the 100 trials were counted. I chose to switch lines 5 and 9, but the real fix was changing the second <code>IF</code> to an <code>ELSE</code> to ensure only one random value is counted per trial.</p>\n",

    "    <p>This was one of the last few questions, and I was confused by the sections. My focus was clearly fading, which led to a mistake I could have avoided earlier in the test. This spinner lands on \"blue\" with a certain probability. If \"blue\" is not selected, the outcomes \"orange\" and \"purple\" are equally likely. The first call to RANDOM determines if \"blue\" is chosen, occurring with a specific chance. If it isn't, a second call to RANDOM decides between \"orange\" and \"purple\"â€”with \"orange\" occurring half the time and \"purple\" the other half among the non-\"blue\" outcomes.</p>\n",
