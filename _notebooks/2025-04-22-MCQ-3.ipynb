    "    <p>I struggled with <strong>data compression</strong>, <strong>mathematical expressions</strong>, <strong>strings</strong>, <strong>calling procedures</strong>, and <strong>random values</strong>. These questions required more mental effort and showed up near the end of the test when my focus started to drop. Some questions took too long to finish—I'll need to work on speed and focus if I want to complete future sets under 1.5 hours.</p>\n",

    "    <p>I lost focus and miscounted how many times the game piece moved. I thought it only moved 3 times, but it actually moved 4: right to yellow, left to black, right to green, then right again to red. The counter increases each time, so the correct answer was 4, not 3.</p>\n",

    "    <p>I didn’t notice the problem was with calling <code>RANDOM(1, 4)</code> twice in one loop iteration. Only 94 of the 100 trials were counted. I chose to switch lines 5 and 9, but the real fix was changing the second <code>IF</code> to an <code>ELSE</code> to ensure only one random value is counted per trial.</p>\n",

    "    <p>This was one of the last few questions, and I was confused by the sections. My focus was clearly fading, which led to a mistake I could have avoided earlier in the test. This spinner lands on \"blue\" with a certain probability. If \"blue\" is not selected, the outcomes \"orange\" and \"purple\" are equally likely. The first call to RANDOM determines if \"blue\" is chosen, occurring with a specific chance. If it isn't, a second call to RANDOM decides between \"orange\" and \"purple\"—with \"orange\" occurring half the time and \"purple\" the other half among the non-\"blue\" outcomes.</p>\n",
