Despite its challenges, this course has helped me grow tremendously as a computer science student. It has taught me skills that even some college students struggle with, giving me an edge in the competitive job market. I'm excited to share everything I’ve learned over the past several weeks!\n",

In my troop, I actively teach kids about Computer Science Principles (CSP), helping them understand the fundamentals of coding, problem-solving, and critical thinking. This teaching role has deepened my passion for technology and its real-world applications. As I look to the future, I am eager to pursue mechanical engineering and aerospace, fields that blend my love for hands-on problem solving with my desire to innovate in the tech world. I plan to take specialized courses and seek internships that will allow me to gain practical experience in these industries. In college, I hope to continue refining my skills in mechanical engineering and aerospace while also exploring cutting-edge developments in robotics and space technology. The combination of my Eagle Scout experience and my aspirations in engineering will guide me toward a career where I can inspire others and contribute to technological advancements that shape the future."

When I started this class, I had no prior experience, which made the learning process challenging. However, I worked hard to overcome this and successfully completed five key tasks that demonstrated my growth and had a meaningful impact on our team’s progress.\n",
    "Throughout the course, I consistently put in effort to learn new skills and apply them effectively. I contributed to problem-solving, teamwork, and adapting to new challenges, all of which helped the team move forward. Considering the progress I made from the beginning of the class, the work I completed, and the role I played in our overall success, I believe a 94.5% is a fair reflection of my performance.\n",

We received several compliments from parents, as well as positive feedback from the Google Form we sent out. This feedback shows that many people appreciated and liked our project, demonstrating its effectiveness and impact. Given the effort put into developing and presenting the demo, along with the strong response from our audience, I believe a 96% is a fair reflection of my contribution.\n",

This meant I couldn’t simply copy and adapt existing code but instead had to build my feature entirely from scratch.\n",

Additionally, my functionality had to be structured differently to handle user inputs, responses, and seamless interaction, making my work stand out from others in terms of complexity and originality.

While others may have taken breaks, which could have given them an advantage in focus and performance, I wanted to see where I truly stood without external factors influencing my score.To make up for my lower score, I have created an extensive plan to improve my understanding and performance. This plan includes targeted review sessions, practice problems, and studying specific areas where I struggled. Given my honest approach to the test and my commitment to improvement, I believe a 91% is a fair assessment of my effort and dedication.\n",

I reviewed and interviewed four teams for detailed N@tM write-ups, showing my commitment to their work. I provided an extensive strengths and weaknesses report for the MCQ and FRQ, outlining improvement steps. I also helped someone organize Final Exam materials and conducted a live review with them to make sure that we both are ready for the check.
