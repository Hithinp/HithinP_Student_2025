    "Overall, I didn't do that bad on the MCQ, but there are definitely some topics that I need to improve on. While I was able to grasp many of the concepts, I noticed that there were certain areas where I felt less confident or struggled to recall key details. These topics need more attention so I can solidify my understanding and perform better next time. It's important to take note of these areas for improvement, as they will help me focus my study efforts moving forward and ensure I'm more prepared in the future. With a bit more practice and a deeper dive into those specific concepts, I’m confident I can enhance my knowledge and do even better in future assessments.\n",
