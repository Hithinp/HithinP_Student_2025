    "      <strong>Performance & User Experience:</strong> Efficient algorithms lead to faster, smoother applications. Just like finding a song instantly with a search bar, efficient code minimizes waiting time.\n",
    "    </div>\n",
    "    <div class=\"highlight\">\n",
    "      <strong>Resource Constraints:</strong> Especially on mobile or high-load servers, every millisecond and megabyte counts. Efficient code saves memory, CPU cycles, and energy.\n",
    "    </div>\n",
    "    <div class=\"highlight\">\n",
    "      <strong>Scalability:</strong> Algorithms that perform well with small inputs might become bottlenecks on large datasets. Knowing the efficiency of your code is crucial for scalability.\n",

    "    <p>Algorithmic efficiency measures how an algorithmâ€™s performance scales with input size. It covers:</p>\n",
    "    <ul>\n",
    "      <li><strong>Time Efficiency:</strong> How many operations are performed relative to the input size.</li>\n",
    "      <li><strong>Space Efficiency:</strong> How much extra memory is required.</li>\n",
    "      <li><strong>Energy Efficiency:</strong> Particularly important for mobile devices, where less processing means longer battery life.</li>\n",
