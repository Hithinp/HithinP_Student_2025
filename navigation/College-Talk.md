## Communication Skills and Clarity
- **Be precise and focused:** When explaining work or ideas, stay on-topic and avoid tangents. For example, when joining clubs or attending college interviews, clearly outline your interests, goals, and relevant experiences. Tailor your responses to what the interviewer or club is looking for.  
- **Use Agile methodology:** Emphasize clear communication by breaking tasks into manageable parts, setting clear objectives, and regularly reviewing progress. Whether in group projects, interviews, or work settings, these skills help convey your ideas effectively and adapt to feedback.  

## Visual and Organizational Tools
- **Flowcharts and user diagrams:** Use tools like flowcharts to visually represent workflows or user navigation for websites and projects. This not only makes ideas clearer for others but also shows your ability to think structurally, which is useful in interviews, presentations, and collaborative tasks.  

## Collaboration and Tools for Success
- **Collaborative tools like Git:** Familiarize yourself with version control systems like Git, as they're essential for team projects and technical interviews, especially in tech companies like Northrop Grumman. Practice using these tools to showcase teamwork and proficiency in presentations and group tasks.  
- **Engineering project roles:** Understand roles like Scrum Master, Design Lead, and Reviewer. Although these are common in professional settings, clubs and extracurriculars might not have these roles formally. Be proactive and suggest implementing such structures to enhance organization.  

## Real-World Applications in Hackathons and Projects
- **Hackathon experience:** Hackathons mimic real-world projects, similar to engineering classes. These include working on the frontend, backend, and GitHub repositories. Strengthen these skills to be more confident in both school and professional settings.  
- **Algorithms in action:** Dijkstra’s algorithm, used in applications like Google Maps, finds the shortest path between nodes. Learn how to implement algorithms and build APIs that integrate with frontend and backend systems for practical applications.  

## Academic Planning and College Applications
- **College rankings and pathways:** Purdue ranks #2 or #3 in aerospace engineering. Plan strategically by taking AP classes or community college credits to shorten undergraduate or master's program durations. However, research which credits each college accepts.  
- **Essay focus:** Highlight projects related to your intended major, extracurriculars that showcase your qualifications, and passions that align with the university’s offerings.  
- **University-specific goals:** Research the university’s programs and mention specific resources or opportunities you’re excited about in essays or interviews. Demonstrate genuine interest and align your goals with what they provide.  

## Career Planning and Networking
- **Referrals and networking:** Build friendships and professional connections to secure referrals for internships and jobs. Networking plays a crucial role in career growth.  
- **Internship strategies:** Use platforms like LinkedIn and company websites to find internships. Click on "Careers" sections to identify relevant opportunities. Keep in mind that internships don’t need to align perfectly with your major; they should build valuable skills and experience.  
- **Portfolio importance:** Create a portfolio to showcase your projects and experiences. A strong portfolio demonstrates your capabilities to potential employers.  

## Extracurricular Activities and Personal Growth
- **Join clubs and competitions:** Participate in activities that align with your passions, such as Science Olympiad, F1N, and F1V. These experiences build practical skills and teamwork.  
- **Coding in multiple fields:** Recognize that coding skills are valuable across various majors. Continuously improve your programming proficiency to enhance your versatility.  

## Academic Focus and Planning
- **Balance grades and projects:** Prioritize grades in high school to get into college. Once in college, shift focus to building impactful projects that demonstrate your skills.  
- **Strategic credit planning:** Take community college courses to earn transferable credits, saving time and money on less relevant subjects.
