Overall, the mistakes highlight a need to focus on understanding data scope, applying logic to programming rules, and interpreting algorithm performance. In the first question, the error came from underestimating the inferences possible from the given data. This suggests a need to practice analyzing datasets for all potential calculations. In the second question, the misunderstanding of the replacement rule indicates a need to improve programming logic, particularly with conditions and calculations. Lastly, the third question shows a gap in understanding time complexity, as polynomial growth was incorrectly judged as unreasonable. To improve, focus on strengthening skills in data interpretation, conditional programming, and algorithm efficiency through targeted practice and review of core concepts.</p>

estimated Year 11 (30.6M) instead of Year 12. The correct growth pattern adds another increment, making Year 12’s total approximately 31.2M, not 30.6M.

choice checks for fewer than 50% hot days. The task requires a majority, so the correct condition is counter > 0.5 * total to identify more hot days.

The predators' count is static and doesn’t increase daily. You assumed it updates, but the program only recalculates mice, leaving predators unchanged throughout the simulation.

You overlooked conclusions I and II. The data supports determining average points, score increases, and improvement proportions, so all three listed conclusions are valid, not just conclusion III.

The prompt states that the average total points and the increase in points due to policy can be determined from the data. You overlooked this possibility.

Doubling the maximum score is incorrect because it doesn't properly reflect the replacement rule. The correct solution sums either the midterm or the replaced final score.
