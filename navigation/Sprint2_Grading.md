Student Teaching - Part 1 Fundamentals
Students will engage in lesson preparation, teaching, and grading. This activity is often called “Team Teach”. The process and purpose are as follows:

Learn Big Idea 3 from the College Board.
Build a lesson using Python and JavaScript for each of the programming fundamentals provided by the teacher’s starters.
The lesson should include a Tech Talk portion, popcorn hacks, and homework hacks. The lesson should NOT have more than 5 minutes of talking before engaging students in an activity (e.g., popcorn hacks).
Be prepared to grade homework. This means having a plan for homework and a plan for grading the homework. You will grade on a “1-point” scale. Weight popcorn hacks and homework hacks in the grading.
Lesson time will be between 20 and 30 minutes. Homework time should be about the same as lesson time.

Grading Guideline
55% is minimum per item
75% is mostly done
85% is complete
90% is maximum perfection

Lesson Review - Topic Relevancy (Stdent Review)
Peer review checklist. Guideance

Scurm Master should coordinate.

Peer grading should be coordinated in Slack, if there are any issues.

Lesson providers will receive reviews from a peers in another class, doing the same topic, by enabling Utterances on your topic(s).

Peer graders will grade on Utterances. Be sure two people provide a review to every section of lesson (ie 2 reviews on intro, 2 reviews on .1, 2 reviews on .2, …).

Assingments are to review corresponding topics in other classes.

P1 reviews P2
P2 reviews P3
P3 reviews P4
P4 reviews P5
P5 reviews P1
Note 1. The purpose is NOT MORPH lessons to be the same, boring!!! Note 2. Student reviewers will be evaluated on how and if you perform a review Note 3. Student lesson providers will be evaluated if the improve lesson based off of feedback. Remebmer/document your changes
