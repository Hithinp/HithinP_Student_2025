<h1>My CSP Struggles: Week 1 - 8</h1>

<hr>

<h2>Week 1: Setting Up My Computer</h2>
<p>In the first week, I started my journey by setting up my computer for programming. This involved installing the necessary software, setting up a coding environment, and getting everything ready to start working efficiently. It was a bit overwhelming at first, but I was excited to begin my Computer Science Pathway.</p>

<h2>Week 2: Fixing My Website</h2>
<p>This week was focused on fixing my website. I encountered several issues with broken links and layout problems, which took longer than expected to resolve. I learned a lot about HTML, CSS, and Jekyll themes, which helped me understand how web pages are structured and displayed.</p>

<h2>Week 3: Adding Features to My Website</h2>
<p>After fixing my website, I added new features like buttons and interactive elements. I integrated buttons for different sections such as 3D printing, CSP struggles, and Boy Scouts. It was a fun experience learning how to add more dynamic content to the site and improve the user experience.</p>
