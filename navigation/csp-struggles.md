  <h1>Sprint Tasks</h1>

  <div class="week1">
    <h2>Sprint 1: Planning Issues</h2>
    <p>Sprint1: Tools and Software Development Processes
By the end of these, students will have gained practical experience in blogging, coding with Jupyter Notebooks, and GitHub Pages; learning will begin with Linux tool Setup, Markdown, HTML, and JavaScript. Students will establish a foundation using essential tools and software development processes to support their coding journey. Weeks 0-3 will provide a quick foundation, prior to students starting their College Board Create Task and Full Stack Web Development with Python journey.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="week2">
    <h2>Sprint 2: Material Quality Problems</h2>
    <p>Sprint2: Web Development Layers
During these weeks, students will delve into the frontend and backend layers used in Web Development. They will learn about the key components that make up the backend, including persistent data (SQL Database). The main focus of this sprint is to empower students to explore the development and deployment of a simple website. Throughout this period, there will be several student-led lectures (student teaching) that provide foundational concepts and help students learn programming and key principles required by the College Board.</p>

  <div class="week3">
    <h2>Sprint 3: Technical Setbacks</h2>
    <p>Sprint3: Web Application, Data, and N@tM
Student teams need to build their own Website, and individuals need to blog their learnings. The team Website should include interests but also requires the use of Python Flask and JavaScript programming. By the end of the Sprint, students will be ready to start many of the technical coding aspects of Web Development; having established a Deployed Website, Frontend, and Backend. In November, the Trimester will end by presenting the team project at the Electives Department "Night at the Museum" (N@tM).</p>

  <div class="week4">
    <h2>Sprint 4: Budget Constraints</h2>
    <p>Sprint4: Warm-up Create Performance Task, Data Abstraction, Computer Systems, Networks, Impact of Computing
Trimester 2 will begin with advancement of Social Media Project, CPT learning and ideation. Great projects contain frontend style and backend data. Ideation for your CPT project should contain frontend using SASS; JavaScript interacting with user events; and a database with personal data structures. Student Teaching during this period will be preparing for College Board MCQ, topics will be assigned.</p>
