  <h1>Weekly Perseverance</h1>

  <div class="week1">
    <h2>Week 1: Planning Issues</h2>
    <p>At the beginning, I struggled with organizing my timeline and underestimating the time needed for each step. I had initially hoped to be further along by the end of the first week, but I realized that I had to go back and reassess my goals. After a lot of careful planning and reorganizing, I was able to set more realistic timelines. I stuck to these timelines by using a detailed project management tool, which kept me on track and helped me complete the first phase successfully.</p>

  <div class="week2">
    <h2>Week 2: Material Quality Problems</h2>
    <p>This week, I discovered that some of the materials I ordered were not the quality I expected. They were fragile and unsuitable for the project's needs. Frustration set in, but I decided to find better alternatives. After spending hours researching and checking local suppliers, I found higher-quality materials. Despite the setbacks and the time lost, I ended up with better materials that ensured a more durable final product.</p>

  <div class="week3">
    <h2>Week 3: Technical Setbacks</h2>
    <p>Midway through, I encountered some technical issues with the equipment I was using, particularly the CNC mill I built. The machine started having calibration issues, leading to inaccuracies in my cuts. I spent hours troubleshooting, checking everything from the alignment to the programming. Through persistence and a bit of redesign, I was able to resolve the issue, improving the machine’s accuracy and achieving the precision I needed.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="week4">
    <h2>Week 4: Budget Constraints</h2>
    <p>This week, I realized that I was running low on budget faster than I expected. Some costs were higher than anticipated, especially for small components and materials. I had to rework my entire budget and prioritize essential parts. After contacting a few sponsors and exploring discounts, I was able to secure additional funding, which allowed me to keep going without compromising on quality. It was a tough situation, but resourcefulness and adaptability paid off.</p>

  <div class="week5">
    <h2>Week 5: Design Challenges</h2>
    <p>As I started assembling everything, I ran into some design flaws. Certain parts didn’t fit together as planned, and I had to go back to the drawing board. I realized that some measurements needed to be adjusted for better compatibility. Through perseverance and a lot of trial and error, I modified the design. The adjustments not only solved the problem but made the project even more functional and efficient.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="week6">
    <h2>Week 6: Final Testing and Troubleshooting</h2>
    <p>During the final stages, testing revealed some unexpected functionality issues, such as intermittent power failures and instability in certain components. With the deadline approaching, it was tempting to let minor errors slide, but I knew that wouldn’t be right. I spent late nights running tests and tweaking configurations, determined to get everything perfect. In the end, I managed to resolve all the issues, delivering a project I was truly proud of.</p>
